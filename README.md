# Customer-Segmentation
The goal of this project is to segment customers visiting a mall based on certain factors like their annual income, spending habits, etc., using the K-means clustering algorithm.
# Project Description:
In this GitHub project, we'll develop a machine learning model for predictive sales forecasting. The goal is to help businesses make more accurate sales predictions, which can be crucial for inventory management and financial planning.
# Brief Overview of the Project and the Dataset:
The project will require you to collect data, undertake preliminary research and data preprocessing, and train and test a K-means clustering model to segment customers. You can use a dataset on Mall Customer Segmentation containing five features (CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score) and corresponding information about 200 customers. Link to the dataset: Mall Customer Segmentation.
# Step-by-step Guide to the Project
Follow the steps below:

1.Load the dataset, import all necessary packages, and explore the data.
2.After familiarizing with the data, clean the dataset by removing duplicates or irrelevant data, handling missing values, and formatting the data for analysis.
3.Select all relevant features. This could include annual income, spending score, gender, etc.
4.Train a K-Means clustering model on the preprocessed data to identify customer segments based on these features. You can then visualize the customer segments using Seaborn and make scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.
5.Lastly, analyze the customer segments to gain insights into customer behavior.
